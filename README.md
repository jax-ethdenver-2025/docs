# Jax

## Incentivized Decentralized File Storage on Ethereum

Jax is a decentralized file storage network that enables users to store files while incentivizing others to maintain their availability. The platform functions as a self-sustaining ecosystem where anyone can participate either by sharing files or providing storage resources.

## Concept

Jax creates a direct connection between users who need storage and those who can provide it:

- File owners deposit tokens into smart contracts to incentivize storage
- Storage providers automatically discover and maintain these files
- Providers receive rewards proportional to their storage contribution
- Trust scores determine reward distribution among providers

## How It Works

When a user uploads a file to Jax:
1. A smart contract creates a reward pool for that file
2. Network nodes discover and begin storing the file
3. Nodes exchange cryptographic proofs to verify storage
4. An algorithm calculates trust scores for each node
5. Rewards are distributed based on these scores

This mechanism ensures files remain available without requiring central coordination. As long as a file's reward pool contains value, the network will maintain its availability.

## Benefits

- **Open Participation**: Anyone can join as a user or storage provider
- **Economic Sustainability**: Storage providers earn rewards for their services
- **Reliability**: Files are distributed across multiple nodes with verification
- **No Central Authority**: The system operates through smart contracts and peer verification

## Purpose

Jax addresses a fundamental challenge in decentralized storage by creating economic incentives that align with file preservation. It enables a marketplace where storage becomes a commodity anyone can provide or purchase, without intermediaries.

The project demonstrates how token economics can create sustainable infrastructure for digital content preservation in a decentralized environment.
